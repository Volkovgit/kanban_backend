# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Project Scope - API-Only Backend**:
- [ ] No frontend/UI components included
- [ ] All functionality exposed via REST API
- [ ] JSON responses only (no HTML rendering)

**Principle I - Layered Architecture**:
- [ ] Controller → Service → Repository separation maintained
- [ ] No direct repository access from controllers
- [ ] DTOs used for all input/output validation

**Principle II - Test Coverage Discipline**:
- [ ] Test plan defined (unit + integration)
- [ ] Coverage target: 70%+ across all modules

**Principle III - Base Class Inheritance**:
- [ ] Controllers extend BaseController
- [ ] Services extend BaseService
- [ ] Repositories extend BaseRepository

**Principle IV - Manual Dependency Injection**:
- [ ] No DI frameworks used
- [ ] Dependencies wired in src/main.ts

**Principle V - Ownership & Authorization**:
- [ ] Protected routes use authenticate middleware
- [ ] Project resources use validateProjectOwnership middleware
- [ ] User/project isolation enforced

**API Documentation Synchronization** (if API-modifying feature):
- [ ] Swagger decorators updated for new endpoints
- [ ] Request/Response DTOs documented with @ApiProperty()
- [ ] Error responses documented (400, 401, 403, 404, 500)
- [ ] Documentation verification before commit

**Task Status Workflow** (if task-related feature):
- [ ] Bi-directional status transitions supported
- [ ] Status enum values validated

**Search Requirements** (if search-related feature):
- [ ] Multi-parameter filtering supported
- [ ] Search scoped to user's data only
- [ ] Results paginated

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
